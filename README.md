# Poetry DB sample page

This is a single HTML and javascript page that can be loaded locally (no need for a Node.js server or other) and lets you access the Poetry DB API at [http](https://poetrydb.org/index.html).

To use, just download the html and css files in a new directory, and open with a browser (command-O on chrome on Mac, for example).
