# Poetry DB sample page

This is a single HTML and javascript page that can be loaded locally (no need for a Node.js server or other) and lets you access the Poetry DB API at [http](https://poetrydb.org/index.html).

To use, download the HTML and CSS files from the src folder into a new local directory (or clone this repo), and open the HTML file with a browser (command-O on chrome on Mac, for example). Make sure the CSS file is in the same directory or some wonky results will happen.
